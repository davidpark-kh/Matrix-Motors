John Burgess, David Park, and YY Kim worked on this collaborative Matrix Motors project.
We created an coded the database together in real-time, discussing the design and functionality of our code. However, we did get stuck on the calculate_total_price function in matrix-motors-functions.sql, where we could not figure out how to store a variable from a select clause.
